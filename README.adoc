= Visitor Demo

This repository contains simple demo of visitor pattern -- a way to organize code that:

. Has fixed (or rarely changing) hierarchy of types
. Expects a lot of new *algorithms* working against these types to be introduced

The repository showcases the problem from a little different point of view: necessity of this organization in Java compared to Groovy.
The problem raised there is to *process all subclasses of the hierarchy differently* in a given algorithm -- print in this case.

== Structure

=== General

All demonstrations contain at least two files:

. `Any` -- it has an `interface` `Any` and three implementations: `Ghost`, `Flower` and `Unicorn`
. `Printer` which contains an _algorithm_ to process them, in this case it simply prints the type and an Emoji

The intent there is to the following output:

[source,text]
----
ðŸ‘» - Ghost
ðŸŒº - Flower
ðŸ¦„ - Unicorn
----

* Naive implementation in the `src/main/java/com/caco3/visitor/java/unvisited` directory (the `com.caco3.visitor.java.unvisited` package) attempts to do it using method overloads and _fails_.
* Code written in `src/main/groovy/com/caco3/visitor/groovy` does the same as Java, but does not fail, due to the dynamic nature of the language it is written in -- Groovy.
* The `com.caco3.java.visitor` package finally achieves the original goal in Java leveraging the visitor pattern.

== Why Groovy does not fail?

The language employs *multiple dispatch* -- the mechanism when not only the *type* of the receiver of the method call inspected to choose a _target method_, but something else, in case of groovy argument types are inspected too.
The method selection algorithm is precisely described in https://groovy-lang.org/objectorientation.html#_method_selection_algorithm[the documentation].

Simply speaking, we do not need visitors there, the behavior provided as is. footnote:[This is true for _dynamic_ Groovy, the behavior will be the same as in Java if the class were compiled statically, e.g., using `@CompileStatic`].

So the demo simply prints:

[source,text]
----
ðŸ‘» - Ghost
ðŸŒº - Flower
ðŸ¦„ - Unicorn
----
